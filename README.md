#### _Â¡This project is currently under development!_ ðŸ“¢
***
This is a program solver to mechanic structures using the finite element method developed in MATLAB environment.

Mainly the program has a graphical user interface and a user manual where I included the configuration and use of the program and it can solves exercises like:

  * Springs
  * Bars in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions
  * Bars with springs
  * Beams in 2 and 3 dimensions
